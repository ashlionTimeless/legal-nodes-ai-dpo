# 🤖 AI DPO – Your AI-Powered Privacy Officer

**AI DPO** is an autonomous privacy agent that automates vendor **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** reviews, flags compliance risks, benchmarks contracts against your internal playbooks, and delivers expert-level reports—in seconds—all inside tools you already use, like **Slack**.

---

## 🔍 The Problem

Companies are drowning in regulatory requirements while their privacy teams are critically understaffed.  
Tools like **Vanta** and **Drata** offer checklists and audit trails—but fall short when it comes to **repetitive privacy tasks**, especially **DPA reviews**.

These reviews often take **1–2 hours per document** and scale into **hundreds of hours per month**.

## 💡 The Solution: AI DPO

AI DPO is a self-operating AI privacy agent that:

- 📋 Automates vendor **DPA reviews**
- 🛡️ Benchmarks agreements against **internal playbooks** and **GDPR Article 28**
- 🚩 Flags **compliance risks** and **negotiation points**
- 📊 Generates **structured, expert-level reports**
- 💬 Works seamlessly via **Slack integration**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload** a vendor’s DPA via Slack.
2. **Attach** your internal policy or playbook.
3. AI DPO:
   - Extracts key clauses
   - Benchmarks clauses against GDPR and custom rules
   - Flags risks and deviations
   - Delivers a structured summary and risk report—**instantly**
