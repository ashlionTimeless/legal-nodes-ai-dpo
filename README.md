🤖 AI DPO – Your AI-Powered Privacy Officer
AI DPO is an autonomous privacy agent that automates vendor Data Processing Agreement (DPA) reviews, flags compliance risks, benchmarks contracts against your internal playbooks, and delivers expert-level reports—in seconds—all inside tools you already use, like Slack.

🔍 The Problem
Companies are drowning in regulatory requirements while their privacy teams are critically understaffed.
Tools like Vanta and Drata offer checklists and audit trails—but fall short when it comes to repetitive privacy tasks, especially DPA reviews.

These reviews often take 1–2 hours per document and scale into hundreds of hours per month.
